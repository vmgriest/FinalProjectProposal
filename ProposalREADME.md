Description:In this project, We are trying to build a money conversion program. We want to be able to convert all types of currency around the world into other currency. We wish to build such a program because everyone likes money and also when traveling it would be good to know the conversion rates for certain types of currency. It will be useful for providing people with a way to convert how much of what kind of money you use to the money the country uses. To use the money converter there will be the necessary buttons and text fields necessary to get appropriate information about the countries currency (exchangerate, type of money, ect.). The user will be able to click on the country where they are from and the country they are going to know the conversion rate between the countries currencies.

Plan:

2 weeks of Researching and writing the code for the Money Converter program

2 weeks of implementing our code using GUI and creating demo and presentation

Estimate of Effort: About 4 weeks worth of effort, the actual coding of this program is going to easy, but the research and implementation of countries' currecy will be tedious because we are going to try to do a lot of countries. The GUI will be hard because we are still learning how to use it and it is new to all of us.
